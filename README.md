# Accurate Tracking Collision Detection and Optimal Scheduling of Airport Ground Support Equipment

Usage instructions for the source data, executable application and  experiment results corresponding to the paper are given here

## 1. Source data

(1) Datasets are generated by the source code "**DataGenerate.java**". For different gate size ranging from 1 to 30, 15 instances are generated, respectively. Therefore, we have 450 instances in total.

(2) Generated Datasets are listed in "**Data.zip**". For example, "**AP3_7.txt**" is the 7th instance with gate size equal to 3.

(3) To illustrate the  input format of the data, taking "**AP2_1.txt**" for example,  the notation corresponding to the "**Table II**" in the paper are given after each below-listed variable.

## 2. Executable application 

-  "**Data.zip**" should be unzip and be put in the same directory with "**Javacode.jar**" at first. Then, "**Javacode.jar**" can run with JDK 10 or higher version using command "**java -jar Javacode.jar**".
-  Each input instance corresponds to one result file. For example,  "**AP2_1.txt**"  corresponds to "**result_AP2_1.txt**" .
-  Upper machine running time limit for each instance is already set to be 10 minutes. 

## 3. How to read the detailed experiment results

Each result file includes two parts. 

**The first part is displayed from the perspective of tugs:**

- "Number of Journeys =5" means that 5 tugs in total are used for this data instance.

- For **each tug**,  multiple trips are listed in increasing order of start time.

- For **each trip**, information about starting (logical) depot, the sequence of task nodes and destination (logical) depot is showed. Taking a trip showed below for example,  this is the **9th trip** of a tug. This trip travels through 2 task nodes starting from 843.5min , back at 884.5min and finish unloading baggage at 899.5min. At the **starting depot** (task node id is 1921, "task node id" is used in the code), the tug takes 12 mins from 843.5min to 855.5min to load 4 dollies. Then, it first travels to **flight 6** (task node id is 6664) at gate 1 to deliver 4 dollies , afterwards travels to **flight 15** (task node id is 6655) at gate 2 to pick up 5 dollies, and finally goes back to the depot. "**num_dolley**" means the number of dollies picked-up/delivered at the task node, "**num_D_after**" means number of dollies attached to the tug which will be delivered to specific flights, "**num_P_after**" means number of dollies attached to the tug which were picked up from some flights and will be taken back to the depot. Please **ignore** "num_pick" and  "num_delivery" here (they are defined but unused).

  > --Trip:9	num_nodes=2	starttime=843.5	backtime=884.5	endtime=899.5
  > 	Depot:1921	 starttime=843.5	 endtime=855.5	num_D_after=4
  > 	Delivery:
  > 	Node:1	Flight:6(6664)	Gate:1	 arrivaltime=856.0	 starttime=856.0	 endtime868.0	num_dolley=4	num_pick=0	num_delivery=0	num_P_after=0	num_D_after=0
  > 	Pickup:
  > 	Node:2	Flight:15(6655)	Gate:2	 arrivaltime=868.5	 starttime=868.5	 endtime883.5	num_dolley=5	num_pick=0	num_delivery=0	num_P_after=5	num_D_after=0
  > 	Depot:2446	 starttime=884.5	 endtime=899.5	num_dolley=5

**The second  is displayed from the perspective of flights:**

- For each flight, it shows the information of task nodes after split procedure.

- Taking a flight showed below for example, this flight has **2 pickup task nodes** and **1 deliver task node**.

  The detailed information of  one task node is illustrated like this: (see also the Fig)

  

- **Note**: that we can use the “task node id” to connect the tugs' activities and their host flight together.

> Flight:1

> --pick_nodes: :2
> 6649(1,1,4(4,0),true,false,[51.0,114.0],(92.5,104.5)),0.0
> 98960(1,1,1(4,2),true,false,[51.0,114.0],(101.5,104.5)),0.0

> 98961(1,1,2(4,0),false,true,[51.0,114.0],(104.5,110.5)),0.0
